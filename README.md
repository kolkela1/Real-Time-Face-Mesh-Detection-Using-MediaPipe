# Real-Time-Face-Mesh-Detection-Using-MediaPipe
This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform real-time face mesh detection using a webcam. It captures video frames, processes them to detect facial landmarks, and draws a detailed facial mesh consisting of 468 points. The system helps visualize facial structures and can be used in applications like face analysis, augmented reality,
